## üê¶ Flappy game

* A game developed with JavaScript and CSS;
* This is a replica of the original flappy bird game developed for the sole purpose of learning.
* <strong>Instructions:</strong>
  * Click on the screen, or use your spacebar to get started.
  * Fly the bird as far as you can without hitting a pipe.
  * As the score increases, the difficulty also increases.
* There is also a version in my CodePen page: [https://codepen.io/jguarato/full/mdKoaYR](https://codepen.io/jguarato/full/mdKoaYR).
